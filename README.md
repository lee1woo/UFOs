# UFOs

## Overview

For this project, we wanted to refactor our existing code for Dana's webpage and table to provide a more comprehensive analysis of UFO sightings by adding more filter options. We already had a filter option by date, but we wanted to add filter options by city, state, country, and shape as well. In order to do so, we removed the existing button and added four additional search bars that would track our inputted search items. By typing out text and pressing enter, our website had a dynamic feature that produced and printed out results automatically. Our search bars had the option of filtering by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

This is what our final webpage looked like:

In order to perform a search, you can go to the search bar at the left hand side of the page. For instance, if you wanted to look up a sighting of a triangle-shaped UFO that occured on 1/13/2010, in White Oak, Pennsylvania, you can input into the search bar as following:

One does not need to input a search item for each category. It will filter it even with one category, but you can further filter it down by making your search parameters more specific.

Summary:

Because each category can be used to filter the data, this website is quite useful for UFO enthusiasts. They will be able to search different sightings with parameters that are either broad or specific. You simply need to type in any of the search bar, which category you would like specified, and if there is a sighting, it will appear. The search bars also keep track of your searches automatically with a simple press of the "Enter" button. 

However, there are drawbacks to this webpage. Some of the search bar parameters are hyper specific. For example, in order to search if there was a sighting in Maine, one would have to know that the two-letter abbreviation of Maine is "ME." We cannot expect all visitors to this site to know the abbreviations of each state. 

In addition, while this data set is comprehensive, it still won't produce a search result if the data set does not have a sighting inputted into the data set. There are occassions where certain searches produce no results. For instance, if you search results for any sightings in Maine, there are no results. This suggests that this data set does not include every potential sighting out there. A quick Google search will show you that there are multiple allegations of UFO sightings in Maine. 

In order to address this drawback, the data set should be updated. The website can include a crowd-sourcing option or a method for other UFO enthusists to update or upload their UFO sightings as well. In addition, currently, some of the search parameters may be confusing to people. In order to properly search if there are specific sightings, some of our search parameters should be more forgiving. We should allow people to type out full state names rather than expect them to know the abbreviations to the state.
